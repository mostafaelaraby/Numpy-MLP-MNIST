# Numpy-MLP-MNIST

## Mnist MLP using Numpy
The aim of this notebook is to write forward and backward propagation using numpy to learn more about the gradients computation.
The notebook is well documented
## Mnist Convnet Pytorch
using the same Mnist dataset we create a simple convnet showing the difference between the MLP model performance and the convnet which is better
## TODO
- try to make a simple convnet using numpy
- adding momentum in the update step
- trying to implement other optimizers using numpy
